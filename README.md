The frontend is built using Vanilla JS (HTML + CSS + JS), and the backend with Python (Django) for server scripting, MySQL to store user information and tasks, and AWS S3 to store profile pictures uploaded by users. VS Code is used to test the frontend in isolation, and Docker is used to test the backend in isolation as well as the web app itself in containers which simulate the website from an user's perspective. It will also be used to publish the website to GitHub and Render will take on the job of making the website available to end users. 

Two IDEs were used for the full stack app, VS Code for HTML / CSS / JS and SQL, and PyCharm for Python (Django).
